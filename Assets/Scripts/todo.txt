Cart Pusher
    X - Sprite
    X - Always be at the rear of the snake
    X - Make cart offset static, right now, the distance of the carts is based on speed/fps.

X Stop pusher from skipping to front when new cart added. (I think this means just adding to the arrays in segment if they exist already instead of resetting them)
X Increase lag seconds on each cart proportional to the change in speed when a new cart is picked up.
